## Browser Compatibility

Browser compatability was checked using both my own device (an Acer Aspire A514-52) which is running Google Chrome and with **[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)**.

Compatability was confirmed on the following;

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![Chrome testing](documentation/testing/chrome-testing.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![Firefox testing](documentation/testing/firefox-testing.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![Microsoft edge testing](documentation/testing/ms-edge-testing.png) | Works as expected |
| Safari | Tested on Browserstack | Minor CSS differences |
| Opera | Tested on Browserstack | Minor differences |


Compatabilty with both Android and IOS devices was checked as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Responsivness:**

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile Iphone X (BrowserStack) | ![Responsivness test on a Iphone X](documentation/testing/responsive-iphonex.png) | Works as expected |
| Mobile Samsugng Galaxy Note 10 (BrowserStack) | ![Responsivness test on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10](documentation/testing/responsive-galaxynote10.png) | Works as expected |
| Tablet (BrowserStack) | ![Responsivness test on an Ipad Pro](documentation/testing/responsive-ipadpro.png) | Works as expected |
| Desktop | ![Desktop testing](documentation/testing/chrome-testing.png) | Works as expected |

The application was also responsive on larger and smaller screens and worked on different devices and browsers.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manual Testing:**

### Testing links and forms:

* Navigation links are working and bring the user to the correct page. &#9745;
* The home page "Courses” and "Dives" links are working and take user to the correct pages. &#9745;
* The social media links all work and take users to the correct social media. &#9745;
* The title of the page "Northwest Scuba Diving" works as a link to return the user to home. &#9745;
* Login and logout functionality works correctly. &#9745;
* The registration form has error handling built in so the user must make the correct inputs.&#9745;
* The forms all redirect appropriately. &#9745;
* Email confirmation is working correctly. &#9745;
* Customers Orders are updating when a user makes an order, displaying the new order. &#9745;
* Newsletter subscribe and unsubscribe functionality is working correctly. &#9745;


### Testing security elements:

* When the user is not logged in they sign up for the newsletter or submit a review. &#9745;
* The user cannot create multiple accounts with the same email or username. &#9745;
* The user can edit and delete items in their basket. &#9745;
* The user cannot subscribe for the newsletter multiple times with the same email. &#9745;
* The user cannot subscribe someone else to the newsletter. &#9745;
* The admin of the site can see all orders that have been placed, those without admin privelages cannot see this. &#9745;
* The site admin can add and edit products, those without admin status cannot do this. &#9745;

### Testing other elements:

* Images when used loaded correctly. &#9745;
* Product images load correctly and appropriately for thir assigned product. &#9745;
* Navigation of the application is intuitive. &#9745;
* When the user is logged in the options change from login or register to my profile, newsletter and logout. &#9745;
* When the user is not logged in the option to login or register shows. &#9745;

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/lighthouse%20testing.png) | Few warnings |
| Bag | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/lighthouse-bag.png) | Few warnings |
| Contact | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/lighthouse-contact.png) | Few warnings |
| Products | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/lighthouse-products.png) | Few warnings |
| Reviews | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/lighthouse-reviews.png) | Few warnings |

The same reoccuring issues were seen throughout. They were minor so not dealt with for this submission. However if the site were to be a live site, i would apply some more time to fix them.

**Accessibility Testing:**

Accessibility testing was done through Google LightHouse. The result was 95%. The only issue noted being that the background and foreground do not have sufficenient contrast in some small areas.I chose to leave this as it was in very minor areas.

![Accessibility test](documentation/testing/accessibility-testing.png)

Areas with known errors can be seen below

![Accessibility Errors](documentation/testing/accessibility-errors.png)

**Performance Testing:**

Performace testing was checked using Google Lighthouse also with a very good result.

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form &#9745;
- Users must enter valid email addresses &#9745;
- Users cannot sign the same email address up to the newsletter twice &#9745;
- Users cannot submit a review without being logged in &#9745;

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted for login purposes &#9745;
- Users must choose from a specific list only &#9745;

Django:
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page &#9745;
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out &#9745;
- User-A can not manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa &#9745;
- Non-Authenticated users can not not access pages that require authentication &#9745;
- Standard users cannot access pages intended for superusers &#9745;



Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

### **Troubleshooting:**

Troubleshooting was quite varied on this project as it involved quite a wide range of different technologies.
The biggest issue i ran into was getting the webhook handlers and Stripe to work effectively.
Stripe is now working well and recieveing orders correctly, after much ordeal.

There were some database related issues which were solved by googling how to clear databases etc.
There were countless other small errors solved throughout the development of this application.
Trouble shooting was managed using dev tools, printing to terminal and utilising a lot of googling. I also sought help from my mentor, classmates, tutor support and my friends working in software roles.

## Bugs

I had a lot of issues regarding Stripe and Webhooks towards the end of the development. This took up most of a week to solve but ultimately was sucessful. The issues i was having were based around using outdated code and having some minor typos as well as a lack of knowledge of Stripes requirements. Before dealing with this error i did not have a form to gather the users address as i did not need it for my sites purposes, i had to implement a billing details form to solve the error with Stripe as this is a Stripe requirement.

Other bugs i found were buttons directing wrong, the shopping bag not allowing checkout and the products diaplaying multiples.

There were some initaial difficulties getting connected to the database, however these were quickly solved and clearing the database was needed as products files were altered and updated.

On manual testing i sent a link to the live Heroku site to a friend with an Apple Macbook. He had issues regarding the redirect when logging in. On hitting login he was encountering a 500 error.

He managed to get logged in but was hitting the 500 error when he tried to checkout.

The app was working perfectly on my own machine. When i created another account to try and recreate the error, this worked perfectly too.
Heroku logs were showing nothing to signify this issue.
On looking at Elephant SQL i discovered that there were three loactaions where user information was saved;
- User profiles
- User
- Email
His email and username were saved and hence, he could log in, but i had previously flushed some of the tables and as such had lost his user profile.
By flushing the whole DB i was able to clear out users and emails that no longer had associated user profiles, thus fixing this error. This was an interesting bug and not one that a new user would encounter, hence, i was not able to replicate it by creating a new user.

There are hopefully no bugs present in the application now, if you happen to come across any, please email me at l.butler1993@gmail.com.
